# PhysicsExperimentReports
### The repository is named 'PhysicsExperimentReports' cuz I think such reports could be universal templates for general physics experiments, while the reports are all about modern physics experiments
### All the Latex projects named 'PhyExLabx-x.zip' can be uploaded to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and compiled directly by XeLaTeX
