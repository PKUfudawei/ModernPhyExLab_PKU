# PhysicsExperimentReports
The repository is named 'PhysicsExperimentReports' cuz I think such reports could be universal templates for general physics experiments, while the reports are all about modern physics experiments

All the Latex projects named 'PhyExLabx-x.zip' in diretory 'Experiment x-x' can be uploaded to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and compiled directly by XeLaTeX

The directory 'Analysis & Visualization' in each directory 'Experiment x-x' includes the data analyzing codes and the producted graphs
