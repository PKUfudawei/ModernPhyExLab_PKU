# Lab Reports for 'Modern Physics Laboratory' (I & II) courses in PKU

To have access to each lab report, you could upload `Lab*/*.zip` files onto [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and compile them by **XeLaTeX**

ATTENTION: The author of such reports is not good at experiments so nothing is guaranteed to be right in this repo!
